# GCP-Three-Tier-Web APP-Deployment-Project-2024
Project Overview
This project is a web application that demonstrates the integration of a React frontend, a Flask backend, and a database. The entire application is containerized using Docker, deployed to a Kubernetes cluster, and version-controlled with GitHub. The frontend communicates with the backend through REST APIs, and the backend connects to a database for data storage.

Features:
Frontend: A React application that captures user input and sends it to the backend via HTTP requests.
Backend: A Python Flask application that processes the input data, connects to a database, and returns responses.
Database: A simple database for storing user-submitted data (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
Docker: Each component (frontend, backend, database) is containerized using Docker.
Kubernetes: The application is deployed to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) for orchestration.
Monitoring and Logging: Basic monitoring and logging for the Kubernetes cluster using Google Cloud Operations.
